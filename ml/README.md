## Research goal

Predict whether Jayne will enjoy a given dish or not.

## Hypothesis

Informative signals will consist of:

-   Ingredients.
-   Temperature (warm, room temperature, cool).
-   Consistency:
    -   Crunchy
    -   Chewy
    -   Mashed
    -   Solid (not crunchy or chewy or mashed)
    -   Thick liquid (TBD, e.g. smoothie)
    -   Liquid

## Product of ML task

Multi-class single-label classification:

1. Jayne will enjoy the dish.
2. Jayne will have the dish if necessary.
3. Jayne will not have the dish.

## Model

Try a mixture of tree-based, instance-based, and kernel-based models ([Choosing a Machine Learning Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/part-i-choosing-a-machine-learning-model-9821eecdc4ce)). Also try text-based models used for NLP.
